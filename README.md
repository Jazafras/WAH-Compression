# WAH-Compression

In order for the program to run properly, the text file "animals.txt" must exist in the same folder.

The output will be the following files:
- animals_unsorted_bitmap.txt
- animals_sorted_bitmap.txt
- animals_unsorted_32bit_compression.txt
- animals_unsorted_64bit_compression.txt
- animals_sorted_32bit_compression.txt
- animals_sorted_64bit_compression.txt

The program will also print the fill and literal count for each file in the terminal.
